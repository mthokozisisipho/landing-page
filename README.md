To tell the truth it was a drag at first to look at an empty HTML file, but before the project was nearly being complete I checked the lines of code and was like "WOW! You did all that", guess I couldn't believe it. The project was fun and challenging for those not comfortable with Flexbox layouts. Flexbox offers great control over alignment and space distribution between items.
